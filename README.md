**cdk8s+** is a software development framework that provides high level abstractions for authoring Kubernetes applications.
Built on top of the auto generated building blocks provided by [cdk8s](../cdk8s), this library includes a hand crafted *construct*
for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer API's with reduced complexity.

## :question: FAQ

### What's the difference between cdk8s+ 20, cdk8s+ 21, and cdk8s+ 22?

These are separately vended libraries that all provide the same Kubernetes abstractions (as much as possible). The only difference is that cdk8s+ 20 generates Kubernetes YAMLs for the Kubernetes 1.20.0 API specification, cd8s+ 21 generates Kubernetes YAMLs for the Kubernetes 1.21.0 API specification, and so on.

We offer the latest three versions because each Kubernetes version can potentially deprecate or remove entire APIs, but the Kubernetes project guarantees that they will maintain release branches of the most recent three versions (currently 1.22, 1.21, 1.20).

### Which versions of kubernetes can I use with cdk8s-plus-X?

cdk8s-plus-X is designed to work with Kubernetes version 1.X. Our goal with cdk8s+ is that if your code compiles, then you should be able to deploy it to your cluster.

All APIs in cdk8s+ are built using the latest GA (stable) and beta Kubernetes APIs. Because of this, YAMLs generated by cdk8s+ should work for Kubernetes running on up to three minor versions higher. 

For example, if you generate a Kubernetes manifest with cdk8s+ 21, it should continue to work with Kubernetes 1.21.0, 1.22.0, 1.23.0, and 1.24.0. (If it doesn't, you should let us know!)

This is because according to the [Kubernetes Deprecation Policy], stable and beta APIs will continue being supported 3 more Kubernetes versions after they are deprecated.

Using a newer version of cdk8s+ than your Kubernetes version is not recommended since cdk8s+ may use newer APIs that are not yet recognized by the Kubernetes API server in your cluster.
