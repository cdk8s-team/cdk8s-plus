**cdk8s+** is a software development framework that provides high level
abstractions for authoring Kubernetes applications. Built on top of the auto
generated building blocks provided by [cdk8s](../cdk8s), this library includes a
hand crafted *construct* for each native kubernetes object, exposing richer
API's with reduced complexity.
