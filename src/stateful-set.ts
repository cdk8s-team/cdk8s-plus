/**
 * StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.
 *
 * Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees
 * about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.
 *
 * Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical
 * container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity
 * for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not
 * interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any
 * rescheduling.
 *
 * If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you
 * can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet
 * are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing
 * volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed.
 *
 * Using StatefulSets
 * ------------------
 * StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.
 *
 * - Stable, unique network identifiers.
 * - Stable, persistent storage.
 * - Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
 * - Ordered, automated rolling updates.
