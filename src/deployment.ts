*
* A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.
*
* You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual
* state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove
* existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
*
* > Note: Do not manage ReplicaSets owned by a Deployment. Consider opening an issue in the main Kubernetes repository if your use case is not covered below.
*
* Use Case
*
* The following are typical use cases for Deployments:
*
* - Create a Deployment to rollout a ReplicaSet. The ReplicaSet creates Pods in the background.
*   Check the status of the rollout to see if it succeeds or not.
* - Declare the new state of the Pods by updating the PodTemplateSpec of the Deployment.
*   A new ReplicaSet is created and the Deployment manages moving the Pods from the old ReplicaSet to the new one at a controlled rate.
*   Each new ReplicaSet updates the revision of the Deployment.
* - Rollback to an earlier Deployment revision if the current state of the Deployment is not stable.
*   Each rollback updates the revision of the Deployment.
* - Scale up the Deployment to facilitate more load.
* - Pause the Deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then resume it to start a new rollout.
* - Use the status of the Deployment as an indicator that a rollout has stuck.
* - Clean up older ReplicaSets that you don't need anymore.
